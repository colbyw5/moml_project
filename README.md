MIT Modelling and Optimization for Machine Learning

Purpose: this repository if for group project during July 15-19, 2019.  The intention was to implement gradient descent for a binary classification model to better understand the optimization process for training a machine learning algorithm.  

Data: The data used for this project is from Kaggle: The Indian Liver data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.
